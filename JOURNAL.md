# 2025-07-04 - Where to begin

This is a starter project so I can learn how to actually design a keyborad with the RP2040.
So far I've decided on Bluetooth support + battery charging.
I'm tempted to make it waterproof, whatever that means for a development board, so I can stick it in a submarine sometime in the future. Who knows. Maybe.
